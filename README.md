**ndio** is a Python 2 and 3 module that enables big-data neuroscience, as well as direct interfacing with NeuroData workflows and servers. More complete documentation is available at [the ndio documentation website](http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/ndio).

ndio is now considered stable as of the 1.0 release in April 2016.

## Installation

Before you install ndio, you'll need to have a few prerequisites. The first thing to do is to **install numpy**, which often does not jive well with the auto-installation process supported by `pip`.

If you already have numpy installed, then simply run:

```
pip install ndio
```

Generally, installation failures can be fixed by running the same line again, which, yeah, that's super janky, whatever. If that still fails, try cloning the repository from https://github.com/neurodata/ndio and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you're still having no luck, try checking out the `travis.yml` file in the main directory of the repository â€” these are the lines required to get ndio up and running on a totally blank Ubuntu 14.04 machine.

## Testing
ndio comes with a full test-suite designed to encourage test-driven development. The tests reside in the `tests/` directory, and can be run with `python -m unittest discover`. If you would like to also test DVID endpoints, specify the environment variable `DVID_TEST_URL`. For instance, if you are running the [example Docker container](https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid/wiki/Installation-via-Docker), you would run:

```
DVID_TEST_URL="localhost:8000" python -m unittest discover
```

If you do not specify a DVID url, the DVID-related tests will not run.
